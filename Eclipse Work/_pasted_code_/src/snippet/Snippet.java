	3. How did World War I help to
	bring about the Russian
	Revolution?
	
	Russia’s involvement in World War I revealed the weaknesses of czarist rule and military leadership. When Nicholas moved to the front of the war, his wife ran the government while he was away. She fell under the influence of Rasputin, and allowed him to make key political decisions because Rasputin seemed to ease her son’s symptoms. Russia was far behind in military technology, and lost over 4 million troops in the first year of WWI. The Russian people were fed up with fighting an impossible war, and seeing their government focus more on the war than its people. It was the governments lack of interest towards its own people’s well being, and weakness in political power, that was caused by WWI to start the Russian Revolution.
	
	4. What groups made up the Red
	Army and the White Army?
	
	The Bolesheviks made up the red army, and the White Armies were made up of soldiers from the French, British, Japanese, and US armies and their Russian conscripts(that consisted of anti-bolshevik Russian parties).
	
	5. Why did the Bolsheviks rename
	their party the Communist
	Party?
	
	Shortly after seizing power in 1918 the party changed its name to the Russian Communist Party and was generally known as the Communist Party after that point, however, it was not until 1952 that the party formally dropped the word "Bolshevik" from its name in order to to create a classless society based upon the writings of Karl Marx. 
	
	
	
	6. DRAWING CONCLUSIONS How did the czar’s autocratic
	policies toward the people lead to social unrest?
	
	He made polices that did things such as having secret police who watched secondary schools and universities. He made Russian the official language so people who taught in different languages could now only teach in Russian. He also was racist toward the Jews, and he let many Russian people break into many Jewish people homes, their stores, and synagogues.
	
	7. EVALUATING DECISIONS What do you think were Czar
	Nicholas II’s worst errors in judgment during his rule?
	
	His decision to refrain from addressing the public after Bloody Sunday(1905) drove the people over the edge. Although he did not give the order for the troops to fire, and he was not at the Winter Palace, he was widely blamed for the way the crisis had been handled. The killing of people resulted in a surge of bitterness towards Nicholas and his autocratic rule. A widely quoted reaction was "we no longer have a Tsar".
	
	8. FORMING OPINIONS Which of the events during the last
	phase of czarist rule do you think was most responsible
	for the fall of the czar?
	
	Bloody Sunday (1905)
